# CLI
Network policies can be managed using the [CF
CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli), using version `6.30.0` or higher. The
[CLI networking plugin](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/) is deprecated.
Policies are currently configured between applications. Any tasks that are
created will receive the same policies that the app it is associated with has.
